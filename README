DESCRIPTION: This is the C++ source code allowing the Princeton Instruments 
PVCAM to interface with IDL(Interactive Data Language). Developed for use a
the CXRO's new SHARP X-Ray microscope.

TODO: Add error handling to all the functions/procedures. Modify getters to
explicitly return the values.

Saved for later:
  pvcam_get_size - assigns value to two references
  pvcam_exp_check_status

Updated files(minus the above exceptions):
  pvcam_init.cpp
  half of pvcam_exposure.cpp
